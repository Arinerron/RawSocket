# RawSocket
Read and write directly to a socket. Like `netcat`, but it also has a feature that enables easy testing for buffer overflows.

This code isn't meant to be readable again, because it was for when I was pentesting software. I only published it cause that way I can use it on another computer when I need to without rewriting it (cause I can download it off here).
